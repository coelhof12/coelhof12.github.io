# My Personal Portfolio (SPA)

## Introduction

Welcome to my website! This project is a **Single Page Application** built to showcase my jorney as a full-stack developer. The website will feature dynamic project updates, demonstrating my technical capabilities in building scalable and performant web applications.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this portfolio is to present my skills, experience, and projects. The site is structured to be continuously updated with new projects, starting with the SPA itself, which is currently in progress. Once the project is fully developed, it will integrate multiple technologies and APIs, ensuring a modern and engaging user experience.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon!** The site is under development, visinting the website url will take you to a temporary 'Coming Soon' page.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Dynamic Project Management**: Projects will be fetched and displayed dynamically using JSON, and hopely later hopefully transitioned to a scalable database (MySQL).
- **Google Translate API Integration**: The site will be accessible in multiple languages through a language selector.
- **Interactive Project Cards**: Projects will have sofisticated animations, expanding to show detailed information and images.
- **Custom Contact Form**: A unique, animated contact form powered by Formspree.
- **Downloadable CV**: Visitors will be able to download my CV directly from the site.
- **Blog Section**: Future plans include a blog to share insights, tutorials, and personal experiences.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js with React Spring for animations.
- **API Integration**: Google Translate API, GitHub API (to display projects).
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages.
- **Form Handling**: Formspree for contact form submissions.
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics for tracking site performance.

## Legal Notice

The site will include a Privacy Policy and Cookie Consent banner to comply with data protection laws, especially since Google Analytics and Formspree are being used.
