# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/`: React SPA entry (`App.js`, `index.js`), route helpers (`router.js`), shared layout in `components/`, page-level views in `pages/`, and scoped styles in `styles/`.
- `src/githubData.json`: Generated by `fetchGitHubData.js`; treat as build output, not hand-edited.
- `public/`: Static assets and metadata (`assets/images`, `assets/my-cv.pdf`, favicon, `index.html`). Hash routing keeps GitHub Pages navigation working.
- Build artifacts go to `build/` (CRA) or legacy `dist/`; keep them out of commits.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install`: Install dependencies.
- `npm start`: CRA dev server on port 3000 with live reload.
- `npm run prebuild`: Pulls GitHub repo metadata into `src/githubData.json`; requires `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env`.
- `npm run build`: Runs `prebuild`, then outputs production bundle to `build/`.
- `npm test`: Jest + React Testing Library watcher. Use `npm test -- --coverage` for a report.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Prefer functional React components; name files in PascalCase (`Navbar.js`, `Projects.js`).
- Match existing style: 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons, and lean component bodies.
- Keep CSS in `src/styles/`; reuse shared variables defined in `App.css` to stay on-brand.
- Add new static assets under `public/assets/` and reference them with `/assets/...` paths.

## Testing Guidelines
- Colocate tests as `*.test.js` alongside components. Cover rendering, routing, and data transforms from `githubData.json`.
- Use RTL queries (`screen.getByRole`, `getByText`, etc.) and mock fetch when hitting GitHub data.
- Run `npm test -- --coverage` before PRs that touch shared layout or routing to avoid regressions.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: short, present-tense summaries (e.g., `Add project cards animation`); group related changes.
- PRs: include a concise description, before/after screenshots for UI tweaks, tests/commands run, and any env/config changes (e.g., new `.env` keys).
- Link related issues/tasks, keep scope narrow, and ensure `npm run build` passes for deploy-ready changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Keep secrets in `.env` only; required key is `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub API fetches.
- If rate limited, you can build using the existing `src/githubData.json`, but refresh it with a token before releasing to keep project data current.
